      Using this mechanism, you can view and install Yeoman Generators from the public npm registry at your own risk.
      SAP does not certify or endorse any of the third-party sites or Extensions, and they are not part of SAP Business Application Studio. 
      You must ensure that you have and maintain all the necessary rights to use these Extensions.
      You are responsible for all aspects of the Extensions, including maintenance, management, security, and support.  
      You will assume all responsibility for any negative effects caused by or relating to the Extensions.
      SAP may elect, in its sole discretion, to disable any dev space that includes Extensions that cause system malfunction or that SAP reasonably believes may cause harm to SAP systems.`,
