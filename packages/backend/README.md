## Requirements

- [node.js](https://www.npmjs.com/package/node) version 10 or higher.
- [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) 1.39.2 or higher or [Theia](https://www.theia-ide.org/) 0.12 or higher.

## Installation

### From the VS Code Marketplace

In the [Application Wizard](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=SAPOS.yeoman-ui) VS Code marketplace page, click **Install**.

### From GitHub Releases

1. Go to [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/sap/yeoman-ui/releases).
2. Search for the `.vsix` archive under Assets for the specific release.
3. Follow the instructions for installing an extension from a `.vsix` file in the [VSCode's guide](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/extension-gallery#_install-from-a-vsix).

## Updates

By default, VS Code auto-updates extensions as new versions become available as explained in https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/supporting/faq#_how-do-i-opt-out-of-vs-code-autoupdates.
If auto-update is disabled in your VS Code, you should update the extension manually to the latest version frequently to avoid supply-chain attack and other cyberattacks.

## Usage

Open VS Code Command Palette and choose "Open Template Wizard" command to open the Wizard.
