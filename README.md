## Description

With the Application Wizard extension you can benefit from a rich user experience for yeoman generators. This extension allows developers to reuse existing yeoman generators and provide wizard-like experience with no development efforts.

This npm [mono-repo][mono-repo] currently contains:

- [VSCode Extension](./packages/backend) The backend part which communicates with Yeoman and the system. It runs as a VSCode extension or node.js application.
- [Application Wizard UI](./packages/frontend) The Application Wizard as a standalone vue.js application.
- [Yeoman generator sample](./packages/generator-foodq) Sample yeoman generator to show usages and test the platform.
- [![npm-yeoman-ui-types][npm-yeoman-ui-types-image]][npm-yeoman-ui-types-url] [@sap-devx/yeoman-ui-types](./packages/types) Type signatures supposed to be used in the yeoman generators.
