# Contribution Guide

This is the common top-level contribution guide for this monorepo.
A sub-package **may** have an additional CONTRIBUTING.md file if needed.

## Legal

All contributors must sign the DCO

- https://cla-assistant.io/SAP/yeoman-ui

This is managed automatically via https://cla-assistant.io/ pull request voter.

## Development Environment

### pre-requisites

- [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install/) >= 1.4.2
- A [Long-Term Support version](https://nodejs.org/en/about/releases/) of node.js
- (optional) [commitizen](https://github.com/commitizen/cz-cli#installing-the-command-line-tool) for managing commit messages.
- [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) 1.39.2 or higher or [Theia](https://www.theia-ide.org/) 0.12 or higher.

### Initial Setup

The initial setup is trivial:

- clone this repo
- `yarn`

### Commit Messages format.

This project enforces the [conventional-commits][conventional_commits] commit message formats.
The possible commits types prefixes are limited to those defined by [conventional-commit-types][commit_types].
This promotes a clean project history and enabled automatically generating a changelog.

The commit message format will be inspected both on a git pre-commit hook
and during the central CI build and will **fail the build** if issues are found.

It is recommended to use `git cz` to construct valid conventional commit messages.

- requires [commitizen](https://github.com/commitizen/cz-cli#installing-the-command-line-tool) to be installed.

[commit_types]: https://github.com/commitizen/conventional-commit-types/blob/master/index.json
[conventional_commits]: https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/

### Formatting.

[Prettier](https://prettier.io/) is used to ensure consistent code formatting in this repository.
This is normally transparent as it automatically activated in a pre-commit hook using [lint-staged](https://github.com/okonet/lint-staged).
However, this does mean that dev flows that do not use a full dev env (e.g editing directly on github)
may result in voter failures due to formatting errors.

### Compiling

Use the following npm scripts at the repo's **root** to compile **all** the TypeScript sub-packages.

- `yarn compile`
- `yarn compile:watch` (will watch files for changes and re-compile as needed)

These scripts may also be available inside the sub-packages. However, it is recommended to
use the top-level compilation scripts to avoid forgetting to (re-)compile a sub-package's dependency.

#### Run the yeoman framework in dev mode

Dev mode allows you to run the yeoman framework in the browser, using vue cli for fast development cycles, and easy debug tools.
To run it do the following:

- comment out the [logger instantiating](/packages/backend/src/utils/env.ts#L38) in env.ts source file.
- in the packages/backend folder run `webpack` or `webpack-dev:watch`, then run the server.
  ```bash
  yarn webpack
  yarn ws:run
  ```
- in the packages/frontend folder run `serve`
  ```bash
  yarn serve
  ```
- open the broswer on `localhost:8080` to access the framework.

#### Run the explore generators framework in dev mode

Dev mode allows you to run the explore generators framework in the browser, using vue cli for fast development cycles, and easy debug tools.
To run it do the following:

- comment out the [logger instantiating](/packages/backend/src/utils/env.ts#L38) in env.ts source file.
- in the packages/backend folder run `webpack` or `webpack-dev:watch`, then run the server.
  ```bash
  yarn webpack-dev:watch
  yarn ws:egRun
  ```
- in the packages/frontend folder run `serve`
  ```bash
  yarn serve
  ```
- open the broswer on `localhost:8080/exploregens` to access the framework.

#### Run the VSCode extension

- Start VSCode on your local machine, and click on open workspace. Select this repo folder.
- On the debug panel choose `Run Extension`, and click on the `Run` button.

#### Advanced scenarios

- [Build & install the yeoman example generator](packages/generator-foodq/README.md)

### Testing

[Mocha][mocha] and [Chai][chai] are used for unit-testing and [Istanbul/Nyc][istanbul] for coverage reports for the TypeScript sub-packages and [Jest][jest] is used for unit-testing and coverage reports for the Vue sub-packages.

[mocha]: https://mochajs.org/
[chai]: https://www.chaijs.com
[istanbul]: https://istanbul.js.org/
[jest]: https://jestjs.io/

- To run the tests execute `yarn test` in a specific sub-package.
- To run the tests with **coverage** run `yarn coverage` in a specific sub-package.

### Code Coverage

Code Coverage is enforced for all productive code in this mono repo.

- Specific statements/functions may be [excluded][ignore_coverage] from the report.
  - However, the reason for each exclusion must be documented.

[ignore_coverage]: https://github.com/gotwarlost/istanbul/blob/master/ignoring-code-for-coverage.md

### Full Build

To run the full **C**ontinuous **I**ntegration build run `yarn ci` in either the top-level package or a specific subpackage.
(When running in a specific package, ensure to run at least once in the top-level package.)

### Release Life-Cycle.

This monorepo uses Lerna's [Fixed/Locked][lerna-mode] which means all the sub-packages share the same version number.

[lerna-mode]: https://github.com/lerna/lerna#fixedlocked-mode-default

### Release Process

Performing a release requires push permissions to the repository.

- Ensure you are on the default branch and synced with origin.
- `yarn run release:version`
- Follow the lerna CLI instructions.
- Track the build system until successful completion
- Once the tag builds have successfully finished:
  - Inspect the npm registry to see the new sub packages versions.
  - Inspect the new github release and verify it contains the `.vsix` artifact.

## Contribute Code

You are welcome to contribute code. PRs will be examined and if it fits the quality requirements and the roadmap of the product they will be merged.
