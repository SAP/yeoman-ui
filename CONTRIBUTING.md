# Contributing Guidelines

## Report an Issue

To report an issue please use the github issue tracker. Please try to make sure you have these in your issue:
* No duplicate
* Reproducible
* Good summary
* Well-documented
* Minimal example

## Issue handling process
When an issue is reported, a committer will look at it and either confirm it as a real issue (by giving the "in progress" label), close it if it is not an issue, or ask for more details. In-progress issues are then either assigned to a committer in GitHub, reported in our internal issue handling system, or left open as "contribution welcome" for easy or not urgent fixes.

An issue that is about a real bug is closed as soon as the fix is committed.

## Contribute Code
You are welcome to contribute code. PRs will be examined and if it fits the quality requirements and the roadmap of the product they will be merged.
