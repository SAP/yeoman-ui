# Contributing Guidelines

## Report an Issue

To report an issue please use the github issue tracker. Please try to make sure you have these in your issue:
* No duplicate
* Reproducible
* Good summary
* Well-documented
* Minimal example

## Issue handling process
When an issue is reported, a committer will look at it and either confirm it as a real issue (by giving the "in progress" label), close it if it is not an issue, or ask for more details. In-progress issues are then either assigned to a committer in GitHub, reported in our internal issue handling system, or left open as "contribution welcome" for easy or not urgent fixes.

An issue that is about a real bug is closed as soon as the fix is committed.

## Contribute Code
You are welcome to contribute code. PRs will be examined and if it fits the quality requirements and the roadmap of the product they will be merged.

## Contributors
You must be aware of the Apache License (which describes contributions) and agree to the Contributors License Agreement. This is common practice in all major Open Source projects. To make this process as simple as possible, we are using [the standard DCO text of the Linux Foundation](https://developercertificate.org/).
